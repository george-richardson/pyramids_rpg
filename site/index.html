			<h1>Pyramids</h1>
			<p>The Pharaoh is dead and has been entombed in his life's work: the Pyramid! Unfortunately for you, he needs souls
				to aid him in the afterlife. The Pyramid is a mystical place built to allow maximum alignment with the stars, you
				have heard rumour of strange happenings within its sloped walls. You awaken with a pounding headache deep within
				the complex. You must keep your wits about you and escape before Osiris can pass judgement on your souls.</p>
			<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
			<p>This game is an RPG for one to many players and a Pyramid Master (PM). Before starting players generate their
				characters using the rules below, while the PM generates a pyramid using the rules overleaf. The objective for the
				players is to escape the pyramid by using their skills to get through three chambers which contain various
				challenges.</p>
			<p><strong>The Golden Rule</strong> - The golden rule of Pyramids is to have fun and not take it too seriously.
				Don't be afraid to do silly voices or describe ridiculous situations and actions.</p>
			<p><strong>Actions and Skills</strong> - The PM will describe each chamber and it is up to the players how they will
				proceed, describing the actions they wish to take to the PM. If any actions are non-trivial, for example jumping a
				large gap or persuading someone you are in fact an estate agent, the PM will call on a player to make a skill
				check. Players have three skills with which they can do this: <ul>
					<li><strong>Strength</strong> - The physical prowess of the character, used in the moving of heavy objects or the
						slaying of foes.</li>
					<li><strong>Intellect</strong> - How mentally agile a character is. Useful when disabling traps or studying
						hieroglyphs. </li>
					<li><strong>Charm</strong> - Is your character silver-tongued, or perhaps a fool with a foot in his mouth? Charm
						is used for persuasion, coercion or even flirtation.</li>
				</ul> To succeed on an action a player must roll equal to or under their skill's value on 2d4, adding the two dice
				together. A player's skills base values are taken from their profession determined below but can be modified up or
				down with items which are also detailed later. Skill values can never be larger than 7. The PM may decide that an
				action a player wishes to perform is abnormally difficult, for example backflipping while throwing a dagger or
				recalling every single Egyptian God in reverse alphabetical order, in this case they may ask the player to succeed
				twice in a row on a skill check to proceed. </p>
			<p><strong>Health</strong> - Every player starts with 3 health, the PM can inflict damage on you when you fail
				checks or trigger traps. If you fall to zero health you die and lose the game.</p>
			<p><strong>Items</strong> - Each player starts play with a single item chosen from the items table overleaf. Upon
				completing the first and second chamber each player will be rewarded with a single item determined by rolling on
				the items table. Some items will have an affect on stats which should be taken into account when making skill
				checks. Other items may not have a statistical effect but will allow the player to describe actions that would
				perhaps otherwise be impossible, for example using a bandage rope to swing across a river of mercury. It is up to
				the PM and player to agree on whether an item is useful in any given situation. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<p><strong>The d44</strong> - Some of the roll tables in these rules require rolling a d44. To do so roll a d4
				twice; once for the tens and once for the ones. For example Apophis first rolls a three and then a two when gaining
				an item, this means he should look at the row with 32 as the d44 roll result.</p>
			<p><strong>Star Alignment</strong> - When a player makes a skill check and both dice results are the same, i.e.
				double ones, twos, threes or fours, then the <strong>Stars Have Aligned</strong>. Pyramids are places of high
				strangeness and who knows what kind of mystical forces are at play. When the stars have aligned the player must
				make a d44 roll and check the result on the star alignment table. Alignments can have gameplay effects like stat
				changes or can introduce a new element role play element to the chamber that the PM will have to describe to
				players. The PM can ask players to reroll on the alignment table if an effect has already occurred once and doesn't
				make sense to happen again. </p>

			<h2>Pyramid Master Guide</h2>
			<p>It is the Pyramid Master's job to set the scene for the players and keep the game on track. Although you will
				often find yourself in an adversarial position to players, remember its about everyone having fun and not about
				winning.</p>
			<p><strong>Pyramid Creation</strong> - Use the tables opposite to create the pyramid that the players need to escape
				from, you can either roll (d6) or choose. Each chamber has a short description that should be used as a jumping off
				point for your imagination. At the start of each chamber take some time to describe the chamber and answer any
				questions the players may have about the situation they find themselves in, make sure to think of way that the
				players can "complete" the chamber if there is no obvious door or way through. You will definitely have to improv
				some answers! A more advanced PM may wish to ignore the tables and create their own adventure, just remember that
				each chamber should be slightly weirder and harder than the last.</p>
			<p><strong>Finishing A Chamber</strong> - Once the players have found a way through the chamber they will receive an
				item from the item table each. Ask them to roll and describe how the item appears to them, maybe an antechamber
				with a chest or just on the floor covered in dust. </p>
			<p><strong>Finishing The Pyramid</strong> - After the players have made it though the final chamber they have
				successfully escaped! Perhaps an explosion opened a hole in the wall to the desert, or a mystical force teleported
				them back to Cairo.</p>
