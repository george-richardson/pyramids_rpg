			<h1>Pyramids</h1>

			<p>The Pharoah is dead! Long live the Pharoah! You have just finished working on constructing the great pyramid in
				which the old Pharoah shall spend eternity, unfortunately the new Pharoah wants you to join him. He has entombed
				you in the pyramid that you yourself helped build to aid with repairs in his father's afterlife. Using your skills
				you must escape before Osiris can pass judgement on your souls. And hey, there seems to be a lot of jewels around
				here nobody is using...</p>

			<p>The Pyramid is a mystical place, built to a specification to allow maximum alignment with the stars, and as such
				you can expect to see and hear things you would never have dreamed were possible. </p>

			<h2>Playing the Game</h2>

			<p>This game is an RPG for one to many players and a Pyramid Master (PM). Before starting players generate their
				characters using the rules below, while the PM generates a pyramid for the players attempt their escape from using
				the rules overleaf. The objective for the players is to escape the pyramid by using their skills to get through
				three chambers which
				contain various challenges.</p>

			<p>The PM will describe each chamber and it is up to the players how they will proceed, describing the actions they
				wish to take to the PM. If any actions are non-trivial, for example jumping a large gap or persuading someone you
				are in fact an estate agent, the PM will call on a player to make a skill check. Players have three skills with
				which
				they can do this: <ul>
					<li>Strength - The physical prowess of the character, used in the moving of heavy objects or the slaying of foes.</li>
					<li>Intellect - How mentally agile a character is. Useful when disabling traps or studying hieroglyphs. </li>
					<li>Charm - Is your character silver tongued, or perhaps a fool with a foot in his mouth? Charm is used for
						persuasion, coercion or even flirtation.</li>
				</ul>
				To pass the action a player must roll underneath their skill's value on 2d4, adding the two dice together. A
				player's skills
				base values are taken from their profession determined below but can be modified up or down with items which are
				also detailed later. The PM may decide that an action a player wishes to perform is abnormally difficult, for
				example backflipping while throwing a dagger or recalling every single Egyptian God in reverse alphabetical order,
				in this case they may ask the player to succeed twice in a row on a skill check to proceed.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="column">

			<p>Each player starts play with a single item chosen from the items table. Upon completing the first and second
				chamber each player will be rewarded with a single item determined by rolling on the items table. Some items will
				have an affect on stats which should be taken into account when making skill checks. Other items may not have a
				statistical effect but will allow the player to describe actions that would perhaps otherwise be impossible, for
				example using a rope to swing across a chasm, it is up to the PM and player to agree on whether an item is useful
				in any given situation. </p>

			<p>When a player makes a skill check and both dice results are the same, i.e. double ones, twos, threes or fours,
				then the <strong>Stars Have Aligned</strong>. Pyramids are places of high strangeness and who knows what kind of
				mystical forces are at play, when the stars have aligned the player must make a d44 roll and check the result on
				the star alignment table. Alignments can have
				gameplay effects like stat changes or can introduce a new element role play element to the chamber that the PM will
				have to describe to players. The PM can ask players to reroll on the alignment table if an effect has already
				occured once and doesn't make sense to happen again.
			</p>

			<p>Every player starts with 3 health, the PM can inflict damage on you when you fail checks or trigger traps. If you
				fall to zero health you die and lose the game.</p>

			<h3>The d44</h3>

			<p>Some of the roll tables in these rules require rolling a d44. To do so roll a d4 twice; once for the tens and
				once for the ones. For example Apophis first rolls a three and then a two when gaining an item, this means he
				should look at the row with 32 as the d44 roll result.</p>

			<h3>
				Golden Rule
			</h3>
			<p>The golden rule of Pyramids is to have fun and not take it too seriously. Don't be afraid to do silly voices or
				describe ridiculous situations and actions.</p>

			<h2>Character Creation</h2>

			<p>A player must roll or choose a profession from the table below, this will determine their character's base values
				to use when making skill checks. They should then take a couple of moments to give their character a name and think
				of a personality</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>d4</th>
					<th>Profession</th>
					<th>Stats</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Royal Guard</td>

			<h2>Pyramid Master Guide</h2>

			<p>It is the Pyramid Master's job to set the scene for the players and keep the game on track. Although you will
				often find yourself in an adversarial position to players, remember its about everyone having fun and not about
				winning.</p>

			<h2>Pyramid Creation</h2>

			<p>Use the following tables to create the pyramid that the players need to escape from, you can either roll (d6) or
				choose. Each chamber has a short
				description that should be used as a jumping off point for your imagination. At the start of each chamber take some
				time to describe the chamber and answer any questions the players may have about the situation they find themselves
				in. You will definitely have to improv some answers! A more advanced PM may wish to ignore the tables and create
				their own adventure, just remember that each chamber should be slightly weirder and harder than the last.</p>

			<h3>Chamber 1</h3>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>d6</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td><strong>The Mercury Room</strong> - Many streams of toxic mercury divide up the room into a strange pattern.
						The fumes are deadly if exposed for long enough.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td><strong>The Room of Reflection</strong> - You are met with your doppelgangers, their positions mirror yours so
						you cannot just walk past.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td><strong>The Bee Hive</strong> - Sticky honey coats the walls of this chamber and hundreds of bees swirl
						around lazily before you enter.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</td>

			<h3>Chamber 2</h3>
